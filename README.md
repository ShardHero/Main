For this I was testing how to use Asperite and I couldn't get the scrolling to work, because at the time I didn't have the full version of Asperite

Parallax image created in Aseprite, test run to see how the program would create the moving background and testing how I could make pixel art 

## GrassHopper code

This code creates the structure of a shape by offsetting it and then booleans it out. I plan to use this to create a structured form to then get an idea of the 3D view so that I can then turn it into the 2D pixel art.

This code takes a shape and copies it along a line creating some organic forms.

I plan to use both Grasshopper Scripts to create a 3D world, which I can then convert into a 2D view and transform into pixel art. This approach allows me to design a more natural and organic environment, as the generated forms create a more fluid and dynamic structure than I could achieve manually. That's why I'm incorporating this technique into my workflow.
